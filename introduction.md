## :question: Where to get help?:

If you are Ukrainian, the best way to get help is to join our [Learn Rust Together](https://t.me/rustlang_ua) community, where you’ll be definitely heard and helped by more experienced members.

There is also our [:speech_balloon: Communicate](https://github.com/ChapliaS/LearnRustTogether/blob/master/communicate.md) page, where you can find a lot of different Rust global or local chats and news streams. 

## :pushpin: How to ask questions?:

The best way to ask questions is to share your code in the [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/). In this case, other members don’t have to spend extra time recreating the problem.<br/>
This is how it takes place in our community, but we’re convinced that it’ll be useful in any other.
