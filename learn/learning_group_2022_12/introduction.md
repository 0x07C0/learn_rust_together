# Rust Course

You will be doing [Rust Incubator](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator_eng) - 
a hard-way step-by-step Rust learning course from language basics to a capability of web backend development.

## Pre-requirements

Before you start the course, you need to have basic knowledge of Rust and Git/GitHub. 
I strongly advise you to read The Rust Book if you haven't read it yet.

## How to do exercises?

Fork the [Rust Incubator](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator_eng) into a **private** repo. 
For each exercise, you'll need to create separate pull requests.
When the reviewer checks and approves your pull request, you can merge it into the master/main branch. After that, the exercise will be considered done.

**NOTE** Don't forget to give the reviewer access to your repo.
