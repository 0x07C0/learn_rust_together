# Rust Developer Professionally

You will be doing [Rust Incubator](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator_eng) - 
a hard-way step-by-step Rust learning course from language basics to a capability of web backend development.

## Pre-requirements

Before you start the course, you need to have basic knowledge of Rust and Git/GitHub. 
I strongly advise you to read The Rust Book if you haven't read it yet.

## Organization

Members of the course will be divided into two different groups. There will be meetings every day in which we will discuss what has been done and what you're planning to do next.

## How to do exercises?

Fork the [Rust Incubator](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator_eng) into a **private** repo. 
For each exercise, you'll need to create separate pull requests.
When the reviewer checks and approves your pull request, you can merge it into the master/main branch. After that, the exercise will be considered done.

**NOTE** Don't forget to give the reviewer access to your repo.

## Certificate and progress

You'll track your progress in an interactive spreadsheet.

You'll have to do a final test at the end of the course. If you pass, you'll receive a certificate.
