# Rust Development Professionally

In this learning group, you will be doing [Rust Incubator](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator) -
a hard-way step-by-step Rust learning course to reveal your full potential as a Rust Backend Developer.

## Pre-requirements

Before you start the course, you need to have basic but confident knowledge of Rust and Git/GitHub.
The Rust Book is a must. Nice if you did rustlings and exercism and had some practice. If you are a switcher, this course is also will be useful for you.

## Organization and certification

Members of the course will be divided into a few small groups. There will be meetings every day but on weekends. During each meeting, we will discuss what has been done and what you're planning to do next. The learning process is built on top of your everyday work on improving your skills using the best learning materials we will advise.

You'll track your progress in an interactive spreadsheet. You'll have to do a final assessment at the end of the course. If you pass, you'll receive a certificate. Your employer will love you for using best practices and writing idiomatic code.

## How to do exercises?

Fork the [Rust Incubator](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator) into a **private** repo.
For each exercise, you'll need to create separate pull requests.
Then, when the reviewer checks and approves your pull request, you can merge it into the master/main branch. After that, the exercise will be considered done.

1. [Create](https://github.com/rust-lang-ua/rust_incubator/generate) a new [GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository) for yourself using this one [as template](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Don't forget to make it private.
2. [Invite as a collaborator](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) of your repository our reviewers.
